# TIF330
Computational Continuum Physics course, in Chalmers University of Technology. Mostly numerical methods for efficiently solving PDEs and large linear systems. Example applications: PIC codes, for EM field propagation studies, FDTD methods (1, 2 and 3D), etc. Most of the code is in C++ (and some Python/MatLab).
